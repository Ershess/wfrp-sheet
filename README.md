## Welcome
### App's presentation

This app is an online tool to help you manage your **Warhammer Fantasy Role Play** game's character sheet.

No Ads, no tracker and no data storage on a server, whether it's personal data or not.

All your data is stored on your localStorage, meaning it stays in your browser's storage, on your computer.

### App's features
  - Auto-filling cells
  - Auto-calculated final values (initial + advances)
  - Dark mode
  - More to come…

## Dev
If you want to modify this tool for your own copy or to make a pull request later, using Node with `npx http-server` is best.

Otherwise, there is no dependency or other tool needed besides a browser and a code editor.
